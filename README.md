# AI 
It refers to the ability of computer systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.
<br>
Note : ML is a subset of AI and DL is a subset of ML. And AI means providing "Intelligence" to machine. 
<br>
Today's AI is subset of human intelligence (Pattern recognition) because human intelligence is made up multiple 
things like Pattern recognition, Imagination, emotional intelligence. 
<br>
The first wave of AI is called "Symbolic AI" in which knowledge-based system and expert system was made. 
<br>
knowledge-based System: This a set of programs which contains multiple if-else checks to give the correct output. 
<br>
Expert System: This is also a set of programs (or we can say decision-making system) which are made by taking the knowledge of any expert.
Example :  Apps in which we can play chess with an expert. 
<br>
Disadvantage of Expert System : It is applicable of closely-related problem. 
<br>
Machine Learning solves the problem of expert system. 


# ML 
Machine Learning is field of computer science which uses statistical technique to give the 
computer system ability to learn with "data" without being explicitly programmed. 
<br>
In simple words, ML means "learning from data" and it does not require explicit programming. 
<br>
In ML, we gives data to system and then system analyze the data and finds patterns. 
<br>
ML works good for small data.   
<br>
Example : Checking the email is spam or not. 


# Data anlysis : 
Analizing the data by plotting graphs. 

# Data Mining : 
Important use case of ml . 
<br>
Data mining is to create a prediction model by applying the machine learning algorithm. 
<br>
This prediction model gives us some pattern. 
<br>
Example : Email span classifying. 

# Disadvantage of ML : 
1. We need to specify the features of input that we give to our system. 
<br>
2. Performance of ML model stablizes at a point with increase in the amount of data given to system. 
<br>
These problems are solved by the Deep Learning.  

# DL :
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze data and learn complex patterns.
<br>
DL is inspired by biology(neuron). But it is just a mathematical model. 
<br>
In Deep Learning, we don't need to specify the features of input. Here System automatically creates the features.
<br>
Performance of DL model always increases with increase in amount of data given to the system.
<br>
DL works good for large data.
